# Advent of Code - 2021 - Using Kotlin

Here are my attempts at the Advent of Code 2021 challenges, all using Kotlin.

Each day's answers can be found in the `src/main/kotlin/` directory, with on Kotlin File/Class per day.

All inputs (and sample test data) can be found in the `inputs/` directory.

I have attempted to use the power of idiomatic Kotlin where possible, but I am sure many of these puzzles can be solved in more elegant and idiomatic ways. I have also tried to favour functional and immutability where possible.
